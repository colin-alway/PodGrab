redirect STDOUT from a subprocess, the following DOESNT WORK:

my_cmd = 'cat file1 file2 file3 > myfile'
args = shlex.split(my_cmd)
subprocess.call(args)

presumably because it's a shell action - would need to add:

subprocess.call(args, shell=True)

for it to work. alternatively:

with open('myfile', "w") as outfile:
    subprocess.call(my_cmd, stdout=outfile)
